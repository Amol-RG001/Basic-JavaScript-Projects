                        Frequently asked questions (FAQ) are questions and answers that follow a certain topic – a collection of common questions that tend to be asked repeatedly on issues such as timing, delivery, and handling, product information, and return policy. FAQs can be anywhere on the page, but most commonly at the top or bottom of the page.

The FAQ is also known as Frequently Asked Questions or Questions and Answers [Q & A]. In other words, we can define FAQ is a set of questions and answers asked by the users about the specific service or a product.

                        The core of an FAQ page is, of course, its questions and answers. You don’t have to answer every single potential question that customers might have, but it’s smart to focus on the most common inquiries. For example, if you have a website for a plugin, some sections you could include in an FAQ page would be: What does the plugin do?

                        Then, you have several options to search on the FAQ page. You can scroll through topics and select the one that best fits your question or you can search your question in the search bar. And there are links on the right side that help you perform some important actions like reporting fraudulent activity.
